    <p>I was visiting Cox’s Bazar to join the capacity building initiative organized for Government officials. The agenda was big: ‘Monitoring, Supervision, Transparency, Governance and Management Practices.’ This was one of four similar initiatives we put forward throughout 2018 – the first year of the three-year Accelerator project funded by USDA/WFP.</p>

    <p>Bangladesh came into existence in 1971 when Bengali East Pakistan seceded from its union with West Pakistan. About a third of this extremely poor country floods annually during the monsoon rainy season, hampering economic development.he newly reported highest peak of Bangladesh, Saka Haphong (3488 ft), is also here in Thanchi upazila. Most Bangladesh sources cite Keokradong as the highest peak in the country, but Tazing Dong (sometimes spelled as Tahjingdong, and also known as Bijoy) lying further east is recognised both by government and expert sources as a taller peak.[citation needed] Measurements taken by English adventurer Ginge Fullen shows that an officially unnamed peak near the Myanmar border (locally known as Mowdok Mual) is the highest point in Bangladesh. Recently a team from Nature Adventure Club took part in an expedition in the Mowdok range and agreed with Fullen's statement. They put the height of this peak as 3488 feet with GPS accuracy of 3-metres. The unnamed summit is known as "Saka Haphong" to the local Tripura tribes.</p>
